### Project Title
Bikeshare data analysis

### Description
I wrote a **Python** code to import data bike share system data for three major cities in USA, namely:
* **Chicago**
* **New York**
* **Washington**

Furthermore, an interactive user experience was created (*via terminal using python code*) to explore the data. This was enabled by computing Descriptive Statistics using the raw data(*and user preferences*).

### Code Structure

* **Functions** were created to represent every part of the project and called later in a main function. This helped with the
  organisation of the code and improved readability.
* User input was taken to filter the data to compute statistics. The data was filtered by city first (Chicago, New York or Washington).
* The users then had the option to further filter the data by month/day/both/none.
* The various statistics are then displayed. 
* Finally, the users are given an option to view the filtered raw data.



### Files used
The following files were used for raw data: (*these are hidden using .gitignore in the local repo, not uploaded*)
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

The _**bikeshare_revised.py**_ contains the code to run the program.

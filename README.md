### Project Title
Bikeshare data analysis

### Description
I wrote a **Python** code to import data bike share system data for three major cities in USA, namely:
* **Chicago**
* **New York**
* **Washington**

Furthermore, an interactive user experience was created (*via terminal using python code*) to explore the data. This was enabled by computing Descriptive Statistics using the raw data(*and user preferences*).



### Files used
The following files were used for raw data: (*these are hidden using .gitignore in the local repo, not uploaded*)
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

The _**bikeshare_revised.py**_ contains the code to run the program.
